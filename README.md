I worked on Web security for the Computer Security final project. 
After the presentation, where I explained the most popular attacks and ways of protection, 
I created an example of phishing attacks, which is one of the most frequently used attacks for the final project. 
it can't detect that it clicks on the wrong link. The only way to distinguish phiisng attacks is to look at the url.
